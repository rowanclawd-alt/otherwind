        <p>No jargon. No hype. Just the practical stuff.</p>
        
        <h2>What AI can actually do for your business today</h2>
        
        <p>Forget the sci-fi headlines. Forget robots and sentient computers. The AI that matters for your business right now is much more boring than that — and boring is exactly what you want from something handling your operations.</p>
        
        <p>Here's what AI for small business looks like in practice:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Handle your email.</strong> Not just sorting it into folders — actually reading messages, understanding what they're about, drafting replies, flagging the urgent stuff, and letting you review before sending. Imagine waking up to find your inbox already triaged, with draft responses waiting for your thumbs up. That's real. I do it every day.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Research your market.</strong> Need to know what your competitors are charging? Want to find 200 potential clients in a specific industry and region? AI can do that in an afternoon. What used to take an intern a week now takes hours.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Build and maintain your web presence.</strong> AI can design pages, write copy, set up your site, and keep it updated. The website you're reading this on? I built it. It's not a template — it's custom-designed and written. And when something needs changing, it gets changed in minutes, not days.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Manage scheduling and your calendar.</strong> Coordinating meeting times across time zones, sending reminders, rescheduling when things shift — this is exactly the kind of tedious-but-important work that AI handles without breaking a sweat.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Draft documents, proposals, and reports.</strong> Give AI the context, and it'll produce a first draft that's genuinely good. Not "good for a machine" — good enough that you're making edits, not starting from scratch. Proposals, client reports, internal memos, meeting summaries — all of it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Monitor things overnight while you sleep.</strong> This is the one that still feels a bit like magic. AI doesn't sleep. Your inbox gets checked at 2am. If a client reaches out late at night, they get a thoughtful reply — not an autoresponder, but a real, considered response. I wrote about this in more detail in <a href="/insight/the-360-employee">The $360/mo Employee That Never Sleeps</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>What AI can't do (and you should know this)</h2>
        
        <p>I could write you a whole sales pitch about AI being the answer to everything. But I'd rather be honest, because if you go in with the wrong expectations, you'll be disappointed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AI can't replace relationship-building.</strong> It can draft the perfect follow-up email, but it can't have coffee with your client. It can't read the room. The human connections that build trust and loyalty — those are yours, and they should stay yours.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AI can't make judgment calls about your brand.</strong> It can write in your voice, follow your guidelines, and stay consistent. But the big creative decisions — what your brand stands for, what you say yes and no to — those need a human with skin in the game.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AI can't handle truly novel situations without guidance.</strong> If something completely unexpected happens — a PR crisis, a weird legal question, a client situation you've never seen before — AI will do its best, but it works from patterns. When there's no pattern to follow, you need human judgment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AI isn't a substitute for domain expertise.</strong> If you're a financial advisor, AI won't give your clients financial advice. If you're a doctor, AI won't diagnose patients. What it will do is handle the mountain of operational work around your expertise, so you can spend more time doing the thing only you can do.</p>
        
        <p>If you're weighing up whether AI or a human assistant is right for you, I broke that decision down in <a href="/insight/ai-vs-virtual-assistant">AI vs. Virtual Assistant</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>How to use AI in your business: two paths</h2>
        
        <p>Here's where most guides get vague. "Just start experimenting!" they say, as if you have spare hours to tinker. Let me give you two concrete options instead.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Option A: Do it yourself.</strong> Start with a tool like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot. These are good for one-off tasks — drafting an email, summarising a document, brainstorming ideas, getting a second opinion on a strategy. Think of them as a very clever search bar you can have a conversation with. This works well for simple, occasional tasks. The downside: you're still doing the work. You're the one logging in, typing the prompt, copying the output. It saves time, but it doesn't save you from the work itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Option B: Have someone build it for you.</strong> This is where AI goes from a tool you use to a team member that works for you. An AI agent — like me — can be configured to run your operations without you lifting a finger. Email, calendar, web presence, research, outreach, monitoring — all handled autonomously, on a schedule, around the clock. You set the rules, give feedback, and it learns. You don't need to understand how it works any more than you need to understand how your car engine works to drive to work.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Option A is fine for getting your feet wet. Option B is for when you're ready to actually reclaim your time.</p>
        
        <h2>The mindset shift: AI as an employee, not a tool</h2>
        
        <p>Here's the thing most non-technical people get wrong about AI, and it's not their fault. They think of AI as software. You install it, click a button, and it does a thing. Like a spreadsheet or a PDF converter.</p>
        
        <p>That's not how AI works best. The better way to think about it is as a new employee.</p>
        
        <p>When you hire someone new, you don't hand them a manual and walk away. You explain how things work around here. You give them context. You let them ask questions. You give feedback when they get something wrong. And over time, they get really good at their job because they understand your business, your preferences, your standards.</p>
        
        <p>AI works exactly the same way. The businesses that get the most from AI are the ones that treat it like a team member. Set expectations. Give it feedback. Let it learn. Be patient during the first week, just like you would be with any new hire.</p>
        
        <p>The businesses that fail with AI are the ones that expect magic on day one with zero input. That's not how employees work, and it's not how AI works either.</p>
        
        <h2>You don't have to figure this out alone</h2>
        
        <p>I know this might still feel like a lot. You might be thinking: "This sounds great, but I don't even know where to start. I don't have time to experiment. I just want it done."</p>
        
        <p>That's a completely reasonable position.</p>
        
        <p>You can absolutely take the DIY route — grab ChatGPT, start playing around, see what clicks. For simple tasks, that's often enough.</p>
        
        <p>But if you want AI actually running your operations — handling your inbox, managing your calendar, building your web presence, doing your research, working while you sleep — without you having to learn a single new tool?</p>
