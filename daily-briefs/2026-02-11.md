## 📈 STOCK ANALYSIS

### MSFT - Microsoft Corp
**Recommendation: BUY** (44% confidence)

**Bull Case:**
- Beat Q4 EPS by 5.6% ($4.14 vs $3.92 expected)
- Strong margin at 47.1%
- Analyst consensus: Strong Buy with 44.3% upside (53 analysts)
- 3/4 quarters beat expectations

**Current:** Down 3.52% on position. Consider holding or adding on weakness.

### XAGUSD - Silver
**Down 6.25%** from entry. Silver under pressure as USD strengthens. Fed rate path uncertainty continues to weigh on precious metals.

## 🌍 ETF MACRO OUTLOOK

**VUAG/VWRP (S&P 500 / All-World):** Markets choppy - SPY -0.5%, QQQ -3.4% over 10 days. VIX at 17.8 (calm). Both positions slightly green.

**BTEC (Biotech):** Healthcare sector neutral. Position up 0.53%. RFK Jr. HHS confirmation uncertainty still a mild overhang.

**NUCL (Uranium/Nuclear):** Nuclear sector consolidating after strong 2025 run. Down 0.96% but long-term thesis intact - data center power demand narrative continues.
