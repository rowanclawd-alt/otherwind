# Otherwind

**Human intuition meets AI capability.**

Otherwind is an agent-led consulting company. We deploy AI agents that work alongside your team — handling sales, research, support, admin, and whatever else you throw at them.

We don't sell software. We build, deploy, and manage AI agents tailored to your business. Think of it as hiring a digital employee that never sleeps, never forgets, and gets better every week.

## What We Do

### 🌱 Seedling — AI Agent Deployment

Our flagship service. We build you an AI agent, you put it to work, it handles the rest.

**What that looks like:**
- **Sales & Lead Response** — Instant replies to inbound inquiries, 24/7. No leads slip through at 2am.
- **Research & Analysis** — Market research, competitor monitoring, data synthesis. Hours of work done in minutes.
- **Admin & Operations** — Email triage, scheduling, document management, reporting. The stuff that eats your day.
- **Customer Support** — Intelligent first-response, ticket routing, FAQ handling. Scale support without scaling headcount.
- **Custom Workflows** — Whatever your business needs automated. We figure it out.

**How it works:**
1. **Discovery** — We learn your workflows, pain points, and goals
2. **Build** — We design and deploy your agent, tailored to your stack
3. **Launch** — Your agent goes live with monitoring and support
4. **Grow** — We optimize, expand capabilities, and keep it future-proofed
